## Research

I started off my research by looking at what petitions are out there already linking to animal welfare and how they are relevant to my site:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DPUbGrXmMHa2VgddGviIw3aZ4n1KlYCR_Uzcjligers/edit?usp=sharing

I then found a story that was on Tv which become the main basis of my site:

Cause to action ideas:

Cause to Action
 
* Offer to start a petition instead or as well as donating.
* Sign up to receive info on uplifting stories. 
* Sponsor a pet.
 
I want my website to convey a positive message. The sad stories and petitions to get inform people but the main theme focuses on the positive side and the impact that anyone can have. 
 
Visualising - transformation of animals through ones that are helped and ones that are hurt.
