## Research

I started off my research by looking at what petitions are out there already linking to animal welfare and how they are relevant to my site:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DPUbGrXmMHa2VgddGviIw3aZ4n1KlYCR_Uzcjligers/edit?usp=sharing

I then found a story that was on Tv which become the main basis of my site:

Cause to action ideas:

Cause to Action
 
* Offer to start a petition instead or as well as donating.
* Sign up to receive info on uplifting stories. 
* Sponsor a pet.
 
I want my website to convey a positive message. The sad stories and petitions to get inform people but the main theme focuses on the positive side and the impact that anyone can have. 
 
Visualising - transformation of animals through ones that are helped and ones that are hurt.

# Our Space

#Brief

We have to make a website to promote our course, which is BA (Hons) Web Media Production for the next year students. We need to do a variety of research methods in order to make this a success. In this document you will find out what we have done, and the steps we have taken to make the final outcome.

### First design idea

![4](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/22593770/26780130/2627197c-49e0-11e7-8353-5aab6e52fe73.png)

### Final design idea

#### Home / Introduction

The main concept is to have the menu bar fixed on the left. Keeping it simple, minimal and clean is what I was going for. The blue was used to ensure trust with Ravensbourne. My main importance was the 'Book a lecture' section as that will allow the user to get onboard with 100% enthusiasm and know what to expect. The design also has information like the Unistats which some people found frustrating to have. There is also media at the bottom which will show videos and images.

#### Course Details

I ensured only relevant information will be on this page. It will give you the UCAS codes, entry requirements as well as the fees. Users can choose what type of student they are and then the fee will generate.

![6](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/22593770/26780129/2626a820-49e0-11e7-8156-ea39d276ec7e.png)

#### Apply

I used the gamification approach in this, users would have to select where they are located, if they press home and EU, they will be redirected to UCAS. The blue BG is the hover state. The admission's email is there as well as the contact form which people can get in touch.

![7](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/22593770/26780133/26359d08-49e0-11e7-80bc-5997a099d258.png)

#### Outline

We thought of different ways to show the structure of the content and we ended up with the one you can see on the screen. Just a simple and nice rectangle that highlights the area selected with the same tone of blue that we've used on the left side of the website. We chose it to be blue because we wanted to gave it a friendly and creative style so the person that is reading it feels comfortable with it. In the right side there will be portofolios from actual students from year 1 to 3 so the reader can appreciate the progress eventually.

#### Book a taster

This is a really important section of the website because it gives the opportunity to the reader to book a taster so they can get the real feeling of how the lecturers will be. The design we made in this page was quite simple as we wanted to make sure that who ever is reading this knows exactly what's going on. We kept the main information on the right side and on the left you can book a taster immediately.

![9](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/22593770/26780136/26408fba-49e0-11e7-8123-8d5b4584a29a.png)

#### Lecturers

This is when the audience can get to know the lecturers better. We provided images and a good biography telling who the lecturers are and what experience they've got. Again we followed the same style as the one "What your course will look like". We did so because we believe that when you're reading about who is going to be teaching the course, you want to have a friendly and quite atmosphere. We tried to represent that by having the colour blue as the colour background for the text and having the colour font white so it doesn't like too formal and the reader can feel more relax reading it.

## Moodboard

![square](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/22593770/26780267/d876bca4-49e0-11e7-9461-04450b829b1f.png)

The above layout is visually appealing, attractive. The content is nothing related to what we have for Our Space. I can still take inspiration from the colour theory, typography and overall shaping used within the layout. I know it is a sans-serif font, with experience I know that sans-serif is a friendly and modern font. They have also used The use of blue is repeated, I assume that it is to enforce trust. The designer has managed to combine the page together by placing shadows underneath the phone, and having a big blue box which is used between two elements.

The designer has thought of how he can place a mass amount of text without it looking boring. He has clrealy thought how to place a title so it is still legible however not dominating other content. This could be something I can try in the Our Space project.
